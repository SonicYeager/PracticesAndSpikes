# Codebase Improvement Tasks

This document outlines actionable tasks to improve the codebase, covering architectural and code-level enhancements.

## I. Architectural Improvements

1.  [ ] **Implement a comprehensive testing strategy:**
    *   [ ] Set up a unit testing framework (e.g., Vitest) for Vue components, Pinia stores, and utility functions.
    *   [ ] Write unit tests for core Pinia stores (e.g., `message-monitor.js`, `preferences.js`, `pulsar-admin.js`, `test-publisher.js`).
    *   [ ] Write unit tests for reusable Vue components.
    *   [ ] Consider end-to-end (E2E) testing (e.g., Cypress, Playwright) for critical user flows.
2.  [ ] **Enhance Error Handling and Reporting:**
    *   [ ] Implement a centralized error handling mechanism for API calls and other asynchronous operations.
    *   [ ] Display user-friendly error messages in the UI.
    *   [ ] Integrate with an error logging service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) for production environments.
3.  [ ] **Improve Configuration Management:**
    *   [ ] Centralize environment-specific configurations (e.g., Pulsar API endpoints) using Vite's environment variables.
    *   [ ] Document all configurable parameters and their usage.
4.  [ ] **Optimize Routing and Lazy Loading:**
    *   [ ] Implement lazy loading for all routes in `router/index.js` to reduce initial bundle size.
    *   [ ] Organize routes into logical groups or feature modules if the application grows.
5.  [ ] **Refine State Management (Pinia):
    *   [ ] Review existing Pinia stores for optimal structure and separation of concerns.
    *   [ ] Ensure proper use of getters, actions, and state.
    *   [ ] Consider normalizing complex data structures within stores if applicable.

## II. Code-Level Improvements

1.  [ ] **Enforce Code Quality and Consistency:**
    *   [ ] Review and potentially enhance ESLint rules for stricter code quality and Vue-specific best practices.
    *   [ ] Ensure consistent formatting across the entire codebase using Prettier.
    *   [ ] Add JSDoc comments for complex functions, components, and Pinia store actions/getters.
2.  [ ] **Performance Optimizations:**
    *   [ ] Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in components (e.g., large lists, frequent updates).
    *   [ ] Use `v-once` for static content within components where appropriate.
    *   [ ] Implement `v-memo` for complex computations that don't change frequently.
    *   [ ] Debounce or throttle input handlers and expensive operations.
3.  [ ] **Pulsar Client Integration Best Practices:**
    *   [ ] Ensure robust connection management for `pulsar-client-js`, including reconnection logic.
    *   [ ] Implement proper resource cleanup (e.g., closing producers/consumers) on component unmount or application shutdown.
    *   [ ] Add comprehensive error handling around Pulsar operations.
4.  [ ] **Component Reusability and Best Practices:**
    *   [ ] Review `components/` for opportunities to create more generic and reusable components.
    *   [ ] Ensure all components define `props` with validation and `emits` for clear interfaces.
    *   [ ] Use `script setup` syntax for all new and refactored Vue components.
5.  [ ] **Accessibility (A11y) Enhancements:**
    *   [ ] Review UI components for basic accessibility (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management).
    *   [ ] Ensure sufficient color contrast and legible font sizes.
6.  [ ] **Code Documentation:**
    *   [ ] Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with guidelines for new developers.
    *   [ ] Document complex logic or non-obvious implementations directly in the code.
