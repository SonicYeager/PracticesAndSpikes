# Code Spike and Practice Repository

This repository serves as a dynamic space for code spikes, practice exercises, and prototyping various software development concepts. It's a personal playground for learning, experimenting with new technologies, and honing existing skills across a wide range of programming languages and platforms.

## About This Repository

As a "spike" repository, the code here is not intended for production use. Instead, it's a living collection of small projects, code katas, and proof-of-concepts. The primary goal is to facilitate rapid learning and experimentation in a structured and organized manner.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, you'll need to have the necessary development environment set up for the specific language or technology you're interested in.

### Prerequisites

- **Git:** To clone the repository.
- **Language-Specific Runtimes and SDKs:** Depending on the project, you might need Node.js, .NET SDK, Rust, a C++ compiler, etc.
- **Docker:** Some projects might use Docker for containerization.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to a project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/project
   ```
3. **Follow the project-specific instructions:**
   Each project directory contains a `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to build, run, and test the code.

## Usage

Each top-level directory in this repository represents a different programming language or technology. Within each of these directories, you'll find individual projects, each with its own `README.md` file that provides specific details about that project.
